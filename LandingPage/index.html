                    This page contains poetry written at 2 AM when my brain decides to act like Shakespeare with WiFi issues.
                        Lower your expectations. Or don’t. I don’t control you.
                        Every poem here has a story behind it, but most of those stories make absolutely no sense.<br>
                        I write when I’m happy.<br>
                        I write when I’m sad.<br>
                        You’ll notice some poems are deep…<br>
                        and some are so confusing that even I don’t know what I meant.<br>
                        So go ahead, read everything.

                           One day, In a deep forest, All alone,<br>
                            When the world felt heavy, and I didn't know what to do,<br>
                            I heard a beautiful butterfly say,"I am here for you."<br>
                            She said she is not good at comfort with a humble, gentle heart,<br>
                            But she gave me the very words I needed for a life.<br>

                            She didn't tell me "Stop it" or "You must be strong"<br>
                            She just softly whispered "You aren't gonna lose"<br>
                            And in those simple promising words,I found a will to fight,<br>
                            She made my heavy darkness feel a little bit more light.<br>

                            "Just cry" she said, made my eyes red,<br>
                            So I let the tears fall,like a sparky cleansing, summer rain,<br>
                            I felt the sharp edges of my sorrow and my pain.<br>

                            She is simple,honest comfort and chased away my fear.<br>
                            So thank you for your patience,and thank you for the "cry"<br>
                            You're the very best comfort,and I'm so glad you're my ally.<br><br>
